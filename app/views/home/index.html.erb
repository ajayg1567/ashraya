 <div class="text-content">Not everyone is blessed with necessary amenities. Though itâ€™s a weird law of nature, the only thing we can do is take things into our own hands. We work on providing the most fundamental amenities any human must be getting. We have destitute women, widows, divorcees, old age women those who were neglected by their Kith and kin. We also provide shelter to orphan kids who were dejected by their parents. We take care of their shelter, food, medicines and other necessities so they get through their life conveniently. We induce hope in the lives of those who would have lost all hopes! Regular health check ups are done. We also conduct frequent meditation, prayer and yoga sessions for the elderly. We even organise religious trips to close by places!</div></div>

 <div class="text-content">We do our part of caring for the elderly not only at our Seva Trust but we also go around different parts of the state and conduct free medical campaigns. In these medical campaigns, we provide free medical assistance to the elderly and also distribute free medicines to them. Our latest medical camp was put up in Nangala village, Coorg district. It was a huge success where we reached out to nearly 370 people from that village as well as the villages surrounding it. Besides these, we also went onto distribute more than 150 blankets for those who were in need of it since it was a winter. Nothing more satisfying than sharing!</div></div>
